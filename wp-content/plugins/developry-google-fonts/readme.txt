### Usage

Once you install and activate the plugin, your editor toolbar will change, and you will see there are two new dropdowns with all available font options (see screenshots below).

The first one is for the font typeface, and the second is for font-weight and style.

Additionally, you can go to the **Appearance > Fonts** admin sub-menu and apply any available fonts to your whole site's headings and body text.

### Features

- You can select from all available font variations and styles (100 ... 900, italic, etc.), and you can use them to style your headings, blockquote, etc.
- You can apply fonts to the whole site and a single page or post element via the editor (works only with the **Classic Editor** now).
- Very easy to use, with only a few clicks, you can customize the font typeface, weight, and style of your page/post content.
- All the fonts are loaded dynamically on a post/page basis using the **Web Fonts Loader by Typekit** so you can use different fonts on different pages, and only the applied fonts will load up on the front-end.
- Lightweight loading the fonts on the front end won't affect your page loading speed.

= Does it work with WordPress Gutenberg blocks? =

Currently, the plugin doesn't support blocks. However, we have plans to add this functionality soon.

If you still wish to use the plugin, you can use the Classic Editor or apply only the global fonts under the plugin options page.

= How do I apply a font to all the contents for a specific page or post? =

Select your desired font typeface with style without selecting anything inside the editor.

= How do I apply font only to a leading paragraph or a heading? =

Just double click on the element text (this will select the full text for that element) and then apply your font typeface or weight & style.

= How do I see what typeface or style is applied to an element? =

A single click on any element, and if there is an applied Google font or style, you will see the Toolbar sections change.

= How can I apply font or style to the whole site? =

Go to the **Appearance > Web Fonts** in your WordPress admin menu bar, and then you will see all the available options you have.

_Note: these global fonts will be overwritten if you apply fonts and styles to individual elements via the Classic Editor editor._
